Javascript adds interaction to the web page. Javascript can respond to events such as the user clicking on an image. Javascript responds by rewriting parts of the HTML. Note, the events that Javascript can respond too can be as simple as the page loading.

Javascript is a scripting language, unlike the likes the of HTML which is a mark up language. The key difference is that whilst HTML is just a series of tags used to give meaning and structure to some text and images, Javascript is a language that you as the developer can program, in order to have your pages do stuff – be interactive.

As such Javascript has many of the common features of others programming languages – variables, conditional logic, functions, loops, objects and arrays. A grasp of these key concepts will help you in lots of other languages but Javascript is a good starting point because of its many uses in web design.

The whole point of using Javascript within a web page is to add interaction very often involving outputting change to the user – in terms of different text, images, HTML or CSS values.
